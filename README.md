# Q.M.C (Quick MAC Address Changer Utility)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Qm2aR7G.png)

This is super simple and rather silly utility to quickly change the MAC Address of a given interface.
It supports both user entered MAC Addresses and automatically generated ones following the correct format for the values.


## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tzero86/quick_mac_changer.git`
2. Install prerequisites: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Execute by running: `sudo python3 main.py`

> **Note**: This tool requires running it as root/sudo.


That's all for now...
