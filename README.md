# QMC: a Quick MAC Address Changer utility
![](https://i.imgur.com/bqw2MF0.png)

This is super simple and rather silly utility to quickly change the MAC Address of a given interface.
It supports both user entered MAC Addresses and automatically generated ones following the correct format for the values.


## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tzero86/quick_mac_changer.git`
2. Install prerequisites: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Execute by running: `sudo python3 qmc.py`

## Commandline Usage

Simply run: `sudo python3 qmc.py -h` to see the options you can specify.


> **Note**: This tool requires running it as root/sudo.


That's all for now...
